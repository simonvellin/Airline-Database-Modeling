# Airline Database Modeling

This is a Data Management project by Simon Vellin and Hannes Schiemann, submitted as part of our MSc in Data Science at the Barcelona School of Economics. 

In this project, we designed and implemented a backend database system for a fictional airline aiming to modernize its flight bookings, customer management, and operational processes. The assignment involved:

- **Conceptual Modeling**: UML diagram outlining customer, booking, flight, aircraft, and maintenance relationships.
- **Logical Modeling**: Commented SQL statements to create normalized tables in PostgreSQL, enforcing primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.
- **Normalization Analysis**: Ensured all tables meet 3NF or BCNF to minimize redundancy and maintain data integrity.
- **Random Data Generation**: SQL scripts to populate tables with realistic sample data for testing.
- **Relational Algebra Queries**: Implemented key application functionalities like retrieving available flights, customer bookings, and additional operational queries.

The repository contains the following files:
